``` 

Following replacements take place:

- redirect = redirect.replace('___', '/')
- redirect = redirect.replace('__', '.')

If you want to redirect to plain `http://` start with prepend `_`
Finally, starting with `__` will use `file://` as handler

Examples:

- http(s)://_169__254__169__254___latest___user-data.patch.rip/t/302/http
- http(s)://_localhost___manager___html.patch.rip/t/302/http
- https(s)://___etc___passwd.patch.rip/t/302/http
